<p>Kuzuto Kirigaya otherwise known as Kirito is from the anime <strong>Sword Art Online</strong>. In the anime Sword art Online is about players who get trapped in a vr (virtual reality) video game called Sword Art Online. Although his real name is Kuzuto Kirigaya in the game his name is Kirito. I like this character because of how overpowered and kind he is in the game, he is known as "The Black Swordman" for wearing all black and being a very strong and overpowered. </p>
<h2>4. L</h2>

    <p> L from the very popular anime, <strong>Death Note</strong>. L is a brilliant genius who is a private detective who occasionally works with the police to solve major crimes he is interrested in. In the events of the anime L is working with the police to find and capture "Kira", a serial killer who is killing off criminals by unkown means. L's real name is unknown and so was he face before the Kira case. I like this character because of his extreme intelligence and his ability to think outside the box.  </p>
<h2>3. Edward Elric</h2>

<p> Edward Elric is from the anime, <strong>Fullmetal Alchemist</strong>. Edward Elric is a state alchemist who wishes to obtain the philosopher's stone in order to turn he body back to normal after he used human alchemy and his arm and leg were cut off magically by alchemy equivalent exchange. Edward is a very optimistic and determined person who will do anything to save his friends. He is also known as "The Fullmetal Alchemist". I like this character because of how selfless and brave he is.</p>

     <br>
  <center> <p>Naruto Uzumaki is from the animes <strong>Naruto</strong> and <strong>Naruto Shippuden</strong>. Naruto is a ninja
   of the hidden leaf village who also happens to be the nine tails Jinchuriki because he has a nine tails fox demon sealed
    within him, it is also because of that. 
    Naruto wishes to become the hokage (The leader of the hidden leaf village) in order for the people of the village to 
    acknowledge him. I like this character because he has a massive amount of optimism and determination.</p></center>
