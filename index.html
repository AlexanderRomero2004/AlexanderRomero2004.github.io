    <center><h1>What is AI?</h1></center>
    <hr>
    <center><p>AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, and just like the name implies AI is when a program or system is
    endowed with the ability to makes its own decisions without following a specific program as if they  were instructions.
     AI can apply to many things such as video game enemies, robots, and even apps sometimes. AI programs and systems also
     have varied levels of inteligence like how video game enemies are able to make the decision to move to a certain place,
    but lack the ability to truly think on their own as they are always programmed to attack the player. Then there 
    way more advenced forms of AI that were built to replicate human intelligence, these types of AI are the types depicted
      in movies like <strong>Terminator</strong> and <strong>2001: A Space Odyessy</strong> , they also exist in real life like IBM's
    Watson</center></p>
